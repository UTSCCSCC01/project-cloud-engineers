# Summary 

## Project Objective
Build an e-learning and community platform that helps aspiring entrepreneurs in Africa. The platform will provide an end-to-end experience where new users can be generated through the annual challenge applications (community platform), users can communicate with fellow entrepreneurs & advisors (community platform), and users can get training and guidance from an experienced team of advisors (e-learning platform).

## Key User/Personas

EXAMPLE: Key Persona: Walterâ€”a 17-year veteran of the reservations center, who primarily works with premium and global services customers. He is a walking encyclopedia of the reservation system arcana and often supports other employees on difficult problems.

## Key Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Community Signup
Kofi and his group of friends have an idea for a platform that aligns with the _African Impact Challenge_. To get their ideas across they need a way to communicate with the organizers of the challenge. 

### Scenario 2: Community Interaction
Dembe is one of the advisors for the _African Impact Challenge_. He wants see company data (company name, goals, team members, etc.) for all the teams that are currently in the incubation stage. He needs an organized way to see data for all the participating teams. 

### Scenario 3: E-Learning Information
Kojo and his team are currently in the pre-incubation stage for the _African Impact Challange_. As first-time entrepreneurs, his team is struggling with how to conduct market research for their target audience. They need a way to communicate with advisors and find resources (documents, recorded videos, live sessions, etc.) on how to conduct adequate market research.

## Key Principles
### Simplicity and Efficiency 
1. The design of the platform should focus on essential features (features that the userbase will use daily). 
2. It should provide a simple UI that is user-friendly, and easy to navigate.
3. The platform should be fast and responsive. Minimal time is spent waiting
